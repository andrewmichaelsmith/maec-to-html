A fork of MITREs maec_xml_to_html XSL transformation.

This is written for MAEC 1.1 which is quite old now - so if you're looking to do something interesting this probably isn't the place to start, take a look at MITREs projects: https://github.com/MAECProject/

I am not affiliated with MITRE in any way.
